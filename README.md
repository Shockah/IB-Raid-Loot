# Linnet

(formerly IB-Raid-Loot)

Raid loot distribution addon used by the EU Ghostlands/Dragonblight Alliance guild Innocent Bystanders.

Makes the loot distribution much easier for your guild master looter. When looting a boss in master looter mode, opens a window for all the people using the addon with all the items listed. For each item you can choose either 2-set, 4-set, Major, Minor, Off-spec, Transmog, Warforged or Disenchant/Pass. Afterwards, all the rolls are shown to everyone in a new window. Master looter can click people in the this window to give them loot. Rolls are sorted first by type, and then by roll value. You're not forced to give the item to the person on top of the list - you can make the final decision yourself. The addon also includes a roll timeout, by default set to 2 minutes. The item can only be rolled on for the time specified, after which everyone that didn't roll yet gets a status of "No response". Note: "No response" will also appear for people not having the addon installed.

The addon includes a minimap icon / LDB widget allowing you to (re)open the Pending Rolls window and change options.
